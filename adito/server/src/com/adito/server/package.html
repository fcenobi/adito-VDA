<p>Contains class for the default container implementation in which the Adito
web applications runs.</p>

<p>Adito is primarily a standard Java web application. However, it
requires a few additional services from the container that it is running in.  
This environment is called the {@link com.adito.boot.Context} (see
this interfaces Javadoc for more information about this environment).</p>

<p>The current implementation of this Context is made up of classes contained 
in this package and makes use of :-
	<ul>
		<li>Jetty - As the servlet / JSP container required for struts and Adito itself.</li>
		<li>HSQLDB - For the Database engine</li>
		<li>Wrapper - For service control and JVM resilience.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Although this is the only implementation, it is envisaged that there may one
day be a requirement for Adito to run on other platforms made up of components
other than those above. For example, in theory it should be possible for Adito
to run using Tomcat for the servlet container and MySQL for the database.</p>

<p>In practice thought, there are still a few areas when Jetty code is used inside
the webapp itself, so a little more refactoring will be necessary.</p>
