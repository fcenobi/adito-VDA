adito is come from ssl-explorer, which is close two years ago.
adito is belong to open vpn and rename to OpenVPN ALS
I am more familiar with adito 0.9.1, that is why i build my VDA(Virtual Desktop and Application) base on this version.
0.9.1 is a nice version and enough for me, even its web struct is too old to upgrade. I will change web frame to brand new web frame: flex + blaseDS. Then i will make it suitable for remote access to virtual desktop and application. 
God bless me i have enough time to do it.
