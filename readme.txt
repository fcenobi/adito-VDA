adito came from ssl-explorer, a famous open source VPN project, which was closed two years ago.
Now adito was renamed to OpenVPN ALS and became a branch of OpenVPN.

I am more familiar with adito 0.9.1, that is why i build my VDA(Virtual Desktop and Application) base on it.
0.9.1 is a nice version and enough for me, even its web frame(struts 1 and pre jsp 2.0) is too old to upgrade. I will change its web frame to brand new and cooler one: flex + blaseDS. Then i will make it suitable for remote access to virtual desktop and application. 
God bless me i have enough time to do it.
